# Shim (A shim made for chromebooks with a goo
## This is a shim made for chromebooks that have a google grunt motherboard. (You can check this in chrome://version) you will see stable-channel-**you-motherboard-name** in my case grunt. If you don't have a google grunt motherboard, DON'T TRY THIS!

This has not been tested yet, so do this at the risk of your chromebook operating system
